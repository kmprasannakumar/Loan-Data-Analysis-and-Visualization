# Loan Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing loan-related data to uncover insights into loan defaults, income distribution, credit scores, and other financial attributes. The project aims to assist in understanding key patterns and trends that influence loan approval decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares the data for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Visualizes various trends using scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to represent relationships between features like income, loan amount, credit score, age, gender, and loan default status.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built using `Tkinter`, users can explore graphs and export results to PDF.

## Data Sources
- **Loan Dataset:** The dataset used is `loan_dataset_5000.csv`, which contains financial data including income, loan amounts, credit scores, and loan default status.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization
- **Tkinter:** For creating the interactive graphical user interface (GUI)
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For analysis and prototyping
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and project collaboration

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/kmprasannakumar/Loan-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization.git
   
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

Usage
Load the data by running the loan.py file or opening the Jupyter notebooks.

Use the Tkinter GUI to interact with the graphs and analyze the loan data.

Export the visualizations to a PDF or save individual graphs for reporting purposes.
